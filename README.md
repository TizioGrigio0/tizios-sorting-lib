# Tizio's sorting lib

I made this library because I wanted to try and understand more about sorting algorithms, recursion and how to optimize simple code.

## What it does
The library contains most of the commonly mentioned sorting algorithms. <br>
I also implemented the recursive version for each of them. <br>
If you for any reason plan on using this library, please do not use the recursive implementation because it's fundamentally worse than the iteration one.

## Some examples of features present in the library
- Most of the **common sorting algorithms**
- **Recursive implementation** of all the present algorithms.

## Bug reporting
In case you find any bug or a better way to do something in my library, feel free to open an issue, I will look into it when I have some free time.

## Example project
I also linked a small project in the repo that shows of the features present in the library.

If you want to compile the example yourself:
```
g++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra example.cpp tizios-sorting.cpp -o example
```
